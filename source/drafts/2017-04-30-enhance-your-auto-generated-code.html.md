Ruby on Rails allows us to generate boilerplate using code generators.
This is a good thing, since it saves us time and allows us to focus on the
problem we're going to solve. However, the auto generated code is nowhere
near perfect. With a little bit of refactoring right after generating the
code, you may save yourself a lot of time spent on refactoring a couple of
months later.

This article was inspired by Raúl Ávila's article
["Review your auto-generated code" on dev.to](https://dev.to/raulavila/review-your-auto-generated-code)
It's about boilerplate code generated by IDEs in Java. Check it out!

Here's a list of things that might require some attention:

1. unused views, helpers and assets
2. unused controller actions
3. unused routes
4. too permissive controller params
5. incomplete migrations

## Unused views, helpers, assets etc.
Often, generated boilerplate is just dead code. Yes, we need a model for
our resource, but do we need a view helper, too? A separate coffee script file?
If the app serves server-rendered html, do you need all these jbuilder files?
Unless you're sure you need that file, I strongly suggest adhering to the
<abbr title="You aren't gonna need it">YAGNI</abbr> principle: Delete that code,
or even better, don't even generate it, since *you aren't gonna need it*.
