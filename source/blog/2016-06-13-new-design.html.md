Check out the new design of this website! I added a header to prevent all the
text from sticking at the top. Looks better now! ðŸ˜¸

In case you're wondering why I didn't add a header before launching this site,
there's a good reason for that.
It took me weeks to choose the right blogging platform, and when I had
chosen Middleman, I thought I had to build some really fancy stuff, optimized
for SEO, using flexbox, customize Middleman and all that. I was busy doing that
for some time until I realized that I didn't have any imagination how my website
should look like (except from totally awesome!!!), and on top of that I had no
text or images to present.

Then I decided to start with a simple Bootstrap page,
no fancy stuff, and to add an article every day until the content would be worthy
of SEO, style and all that. Well, three articles is enough to justify adding
a header, I guess.
