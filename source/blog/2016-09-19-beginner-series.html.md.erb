Today I'm starting a series of beginner tutorials for budding web developers. I expect the reader to have a basic understanding of the topic. My goal is to provide some best practices that go a little beyond "Hello World". The articles will cover Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and some other related stuff.

### Articles tagged "beginner series"

<% blog.articles.select{|a| a.tags.include?("beginner series")}.each do |article| %>
- <%= link_to article.title, article %>
<% end %>
